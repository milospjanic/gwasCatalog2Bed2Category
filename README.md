# gwasCatalog2Bed2Category
This is the script that will connect to http://www.genome.gov, download GWAS Catalog, convert it to a bed file with "chr position position+1 proxy_gene phenotype", and then take all your input search terms and select those entries in the catalog that match the term, and create separate bed files for each search term.
Script will create and call two 'subscripts' GwasCatalog2Bed.sh and main.sh. Main.sh will be removed while GwasCatalog2Bed.sh will not be removed and you can use it afterwards to download whole GWAS Catalog in bed format.
Files that will be generated are: GwasCatalog.bed, which contains shorter bed version of the entire GWAS Catalog and phenotype specific bed files.

#Usage
Enter all search terms as arguments passed to a Bash script and if your serach term is a phrase use double quotes. Note that names of phenotypes in GWAS Catalog start with capital letter but then next word is with small letter.
